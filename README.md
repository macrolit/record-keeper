# Record Keeper

Advanced CLI tool for automation of Personal Knowledge Management

## What is it?

A modular, highly-configurable, platform-agnostic, extensible, universal yaml-markdown workflow for bulk processing and decentralized archival of exportable collections from any source.

## What does it do?

- Turn your social media exports into .md notes with flexible properties.
- Integrate seamlessly with RRSS feeds and categorize your highlights
- Avoid Zettelkasten chaos and aglomeration
- File-system based categorization

It supports a flexible info-management workflow by converting individual entries from most filetype contents imports into yaml frontmatter (.md). 
The project also features optional remote or local (ollama) LLM categorization and enrichment.

>  "The missing link between website exports, knowledge management tools, categorization and 
>  AI enrichment - with a CLI-first, plugin-extensible, git-native architecture."



## How to use it?

Simply clone the git repo and install it with -e (editable) in an accessible location ()

```sh
git clone https://github.com/macrolit/record-keeper
cd record-keeper
pipx install -e . --python3.11
```
Currently stable using python <3.12

Test the tool

```sh
rk --help
rk ls
rk init ls
```

## Features

- Convert and normalize exports into Markdown with YAML frontmatter.
- Bulk-process large archives or collections from any source.
- Enrich and categorize files with local or remote LLM models.
- Integrate cleanly with markdown-based PKM systems.
- Automate processing with a flexible user-driven plugin/module system.

## Module System

record-keeper supports git-managed plugin modules for parsing, processing, automation, and prompts.
Anyone can easily contribute by simply uploading an installable plugin to github.


## Open Source Models 

==The tool will ship along a dedicated endpoint==
An AI categorization endpoint will be launched along the tool, so that users can quickly try it out!
Tuned infrastructure for large cost-efficient workloads, easy to use and try out with curl commands

It's always opt-in, optional and configurable. You can simply use ollama or your preference of infrastructure

(support for other OpenAi-compatible generic localhost api's soon!)


### Markdown Accent

The project currently supports standard GFM (Git Flavored Markdown) with YAML frontmatter as metadata.
Support for other metadata types may be added in future updates.


### Individual Online Site Support

The tool will ship with general basic support for `JSON , CSV , HTML,` and etc. 
As well as specific conversion handlers for data export formats such as Google-Takeout, Meta Exports, Bookmarks and more.
For new conversion methods, handlers or platforms not yet supported; 
                                          ==Any individual is free to create a dedicated plugin or submit a PR to be added as core utility.==
Documentation is provided as well as guides for creating modules.

### Expand beyond basics

The `rk init <source> <type>` ships an array of category directories. 
You can easily create or remove categories and subcategories manually and these will be valid sources for directory creation as `<source>`.
The prompts can be edited in the `src/rk/prompts/` and directories will be recognized as categories.
You can also create new .yaml files in the `config/sources/` directory or modify existing, these will be added as category context for the LLM prompt.
For personalized LLM processing, you can define custom system messages as well.

# RecordKeeper's Unique Position

## Similar tools exist, but none combine these features:

**vs. bookmark managers (buku, linkding, shiori):**
- Portable YAML files (not locked in a database)
- Plugin system for extensibility
- AI-powered metadata enrichment

**vs. web clippers (Obsidian clipper, Notion clipper):**
- Works with bulk HTML exports (not one-at-a-time)
- Imports from most-if-not-all file types instead from HTML only
- Editor-agnostic (works with Obsidian, Emacs, or plain files)
- Self-contained, deployable (no browser extension required)

**vs. archival tools (ArchiveBox, Wallabag):**
- Lightweight metadata focus (not full page archival)
- CLI-first (not web UI)
- Personal Knowledge management integration
- AI enhancements and automated categorisation

**vs. data liberation tools (yt-dlp, gallery-dl):**
- Easy integration with existing repositories
- Parsing, organization and enrichment only (not extraction)
- Multi-platform unified handling



>  `rk` is the tool for when platforms lack export APIs and you need
>  your saved content in a format that will outlive social media hosting.


# No conversion support for your export type? make your own!

Plugins are very easy to make, 
- Use existing templates 
- Simply follow a guideline
- Vibe-coding ready prompts. just copy-paste
- Package manager `mod` as using `rk mod get username/plugin` with smart git integration

Plugins are dead-simple to make. Please read the PLUGINS.md and simply follow the guide.


Share your plugin in [website still not decided] and help the community grow!


# No export? No problem

IF you can acces YOUR data through a browser, it's completely yours.
Use dev tools and parse HTML with two clicks. No built-in export required.

# For developers

You can review the `cli.py` logic and make adjustments to your preferences or add feature improvements.
Code changes are instant and live, so you don't need to reload or recompile anything.

Make a pull request and will be reviewed ASAP

## File Processing Workflow

Default: Export > Convert > Parse > Process > Deploy 

Optional: Retrieve, Categorize(AI), Enrich(AI)



## Future implementations

- Extensive support (testing) of newer Ai models
- Image-to-text character recognition and sketch/drawing interpretation
- Widespread compatibility
- Exportable datasets
- Platform migration options
