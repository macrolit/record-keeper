# Record Keeper

Advanced CLI tool for automation of Personal Knowledge Management

## What is it?

A modular, highly-configurable, platform-agnostic, extensible, universal file conversion workflow for bulk processing and decentralized archival of exportable collections from any source.

## What does it currently do?

The project is supposed to serve as a standardized playground for media conversion, retrieval, export and enrichment. Servings as a ground base structure and playground for utilization of conversion scripts along with LLM enhancement.

The initial scope is to:

- Turn your social media exports into .md notes with flexible properties.
- Integrate seamlessly with RRSS feeds and categorize your highlights
- Avoid Zettelkasten chaos and aglomeration
- File-system based categorization

It supports a flexible info-management workflow by converting individual entries from most filetype contents imports into yaml frontmatter (.md). 
The project also features optional remote or local (ollama) LLM categorization and enrichment.

## Why only PKM's? (Personal Knowledge Managers)

The project is not locked down to note-taking or archival centric workflows.

However, it initially ships with a strong intended focus for yaml-markdown use-cases. Support for other parsing mechanisms can be easily integrated, 
such as JSON metadata support or platform migration or automation using tools like N8N.

Since of it's modular agnosticism, the same workflow can also be realistically utilized for the following use cases:

- Direct image-to-text bulk automation
- File-type generation
- Any combination of format-to-format file conversions
- Global multimedia interpretation and transcription engines
- Sortcut adaptations for live LLM completions for text editing
- Account/platform migration


>  "The missing link between website exports, knowledge management tools, categorization and 
>  AI enrichment - with a CLI-first, plugin-extensible, git-native architecture."

## How to use it?

Simply clone the git repo and install it with -e (editable) in an accessible location ()

```sh
git clone https://github.com/macrolit/record-keeper
cd record-keeper
pipx install -e . --python3.11
```
Currently stable using python <3.12

Test the tool

```sh
Notes:
  - Source and type names are case-insensitive
  - Initialization prevents overwriting existing directories
  - Structure is populated from the 'structure:' field in source config files
  - Multiple instances can exist at different locations; use 'cd' to navigate

# Examples:
  # Directory binding and navigation
  rk bind ~/Documents/collections     # bind directory so you don't have to specify paths every time
  rk ls @                             # Should output ~/Documents/collections , along with subdirs (bookmarks, etc.)
  rk ls                               # Should output ~/Documents/collections , along with subdirs (bookmarks, etc.)
  rk sel bookmarks                    # Select. Similar to "cd" command. Path resolution (pr) can jump down up to a depth of 2 dirs without sel
  rk <command> <args> @firefox        # Theoretical case where firefox exists in "bookmarks/firefox", no need to sel
  rk <command> <args> @firefox/user   # Out of pr reach, use either "rk ... @firefox/user" or "rk sel bookmars/firefox" then "rk ... @user" 
  rk unbind                           # Unbind ~/Documents/collections. Bound dirs history can be viewed with "rk init ls". You can use path                                         resolutions anywhere regardless of current pwd. 

# Run examples
  rk convert <args> /home/user/here /home/user/record-keeper/tmp/                # Rely completely in the current script args for path handling
  rk convert <args> input=/home/user/here output=/home/user/record-keeper/tmp/   # Use standardized path handling (same across scripts)
  rk convert <args> input /home/user/here output /home/user/record-keeper/tmp/   # Same
  rk convert <args> in=/home/user/here out=/home/user/record-keeper/tmp/         # Same
  rk convert <args> in /home/user/here out /home/user/record-keeper/tmp/         # Same
  rk convert <args> in=@ out=%tmp/                                               # Same (recommended approach) using
                                                                                 # bound + rk path resolution

## Features

- Convert and normalize exports into Markdown with YAML frontmatter.
- Bulk-process large archives or collections from any source.
- Enrich and categorize files with local or remote LLM models.
- Integrate cleanly with markdown-based PKM systems.
- Automate processing with a flexible user-driven plugin/module system.

## Module System

record-keeper supports git-managed plugin modules for parsing, processing, automation, and prompts.
Anyone can easily contribute by simply uploading an installable plugin to github.


## Open Source Models 

==The tool will ship along a dedicated endpoint==
An AI categorization endpoint will be launched along the tool, so that users can quickly try it out!
Tuned infrastructure for large cost-efficient workloads, easy to use and try out with curl commands

It's always opt-in, optional and configurable. You can simply use ollama or your preference of infrastructure

(support for other OpenAi-compatible generic localhost api's soon!)


### Markdown Accent

The project currently supports standard GFM (Git Flavored Markdown) with YAML frontmatter as metadata.
Support for other metadata types may be added in future updates.


### Individual Online Site Support

The tool will ship with general basic support for `JSON , CSV , HTML,` and etc. 
As well as specific conversion handlers for data export formats such as Google-Takeout, Meta Exports, Bookmarks and more.
For new conversion methods, handlers or platforms not yet supported; 
                                          ==Any individual is free to create a dedicated plugin or submit a PR to be added as core utility.==
Documentation is provided as well as guides for creating modules.

### Expand beyond basics

The `rk init <source> <type>` ships an array of category directories. 
You can easily create or remove categories and subcategories manually and these will be valid sources for directory creation as `<source>`.
The prompts can be edited in the `src/rk/prompts/` and directories will be recognized as categories.
You can also create new .yaml files in the `config/sources/` directory or modify existing, these will be added as category context for the LLM prompt.
For personalized LLM processing, you can define custom system messages as well.

# RecordKeeper's Unique Position

## Similar tools exist, but none combine these features:

**vs. bookmark managers (buku, linkding, shiori):**
- Portable YAML files (not locked in a database)
- Plugin system for extensibility
- AI-powered metadata enrichment

**vs. web clippers (Obsidian clipper, Notion clipper):**
- Works with bulk HTML exports (not one-at-a-time)
- Imports from most-if-not-all file types instead from HTML only
- Editor-agnostic (works with Obsidian, Emacs, or plain files)
- Self-contained, deployable (no browser extension required)

**vs. archival tools (ArchiveBox, Wallabag):**
- Lightweight metadata focus (not full page archival)
- CLI-first (not web UI)
- Personal Knowledge management integration
- AI enhancements and automated categorisation

**vs. data liberation tools (yt-dlp, gallery-dl):**
- Easy integration with existing repositories
- Parsing, organization and enrichment only (not extraction)
- Multi-platform unified handling



>  `rk` is the tool for when platforms lack export APIs and you need
>  your saved content in a format that will outlive social media hosting.


# No conversion support for your export type? make your own!

Plugins are very easy to make, 
- Use existing templates 
- Simply follow a guideline
- Vibe-coding ready prompts. just copy-paste
- Package manager `mod` as using `rk mod get username/plugin` with smart git integration

Plugins are dead-simple to make. Please read the PLUGINS.md and simply follow the guide.


Share your plugin in [website still not decided] and help the community grow!


# No export? No problem

IF you can acces YOUR data through a browser, it's completely yours.
Use dev tools and parse HTML with two clicks. No built-in export required.

# For developers

You can review the `cli.py` logic and make adjustments to your preferences or add feature improvements.
Code changes are instant and live, so you don't need to reload or recompile anything.

Make a pull request and will be reviewed ASAP

## File Processing Workflow

Default: Export > Convert > Parse > Process > Deploy 

Optional: Retrieve, Categorize(AI), Enrich(AI)




# Editor Support Beyond Basic Markdown

Any Markdown-enabled editor should be sufficient for viewing and editing the generated notes.

Nevertheless, some PKMs have more comprehensive toolkits and feature support than others.
